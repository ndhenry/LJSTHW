# Lesson 7 Tables
Its simple as you'd guess. Study this example:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>Color</th>
        <tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Apple</td><td>Red</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Mango</td><td>Orange</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Strawberry</td><td>Red</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Pitaya</td><td>Magenta</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Can omit the thead and tbody tags as they will be assumed. Usually just included for CSS styling reasons.

## Tags to Remember:
* table -- This starts a table off and contains all of the other tags.
* thead -- Starts the header row, which can contain labels for each column.
* tr -- Defines a row.
* td -- Defines one column of a row.
* th -- Defines a table column heading.
* tbody -- Configures the body of the table, and usually comes after thead.
* tfoot -- If there's a header, there's a footer.
